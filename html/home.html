    <h2>About This Site</h2>
    <p>
        This is a website.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is simple because it doesn't need to be complicated.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is small because it doesn't need to be large.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is powered by a simple server that responds with static html. It doesn't have any client side JavaScript, it doesn't
        have any CSS, there is no unnecessary bloat.
    </p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a human person.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like to write code, talk about free software, evangelize the powers of vim, and rant about the modern
        internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        I want to solve real problems that effect real people. I believe software is a powerful tool to improve the
        lives
        of those around us and I want to invest my time in projects seeking to leverage that power.
    </p>

        Software Engineering also allows for a unique form of self-expression. Taking time to build useless projects and
        just enjoy the art of making things is at the core of why programming is awesome.
