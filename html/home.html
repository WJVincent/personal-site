    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a human person. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I like to write code, talk about free software, evangelize the powers of vim, and rant about the modern internet being unnecessarily bloated.
    </p>
    <p>I want to solve real problems that effect real people. I believe software is a powerful tool to improve the lives of those around us and I want to invest my time in projects seeking to leverage that power.</p>
    <p>Software Engineering also allows for a unique form of self-expression. Taking time to build useless projects and just enjoy the art of making things is at the core of why programming is awesome.</p>
